1. Functional Requirements
User Management
Users should be able to sign up and log in (Authentication & Authorization).

Users should be able to update their profile information.

Admins should have access to view all user logs.
Logging out is disabled until the end of the workday.

breaks and movement allowances are made 

Geolocation-Based Logging
The app should detect when a user arrives at a specific location.

The app should detect when a user leaves the location.

The system should log the user's timestamp, location, and device ID.

Logging should be automatic based on geofencing.

Users should be able to manually check in in case of GPS issues.

Data Storage and Management
A database should store:

User details (ID, Name, Email, Role).

Location logs (User ID, Timestamp, Coordinates, Status: "IN"/"OUT").

The database should support retrieving logs for a given user and time range.

Notifications and Alerts
Notify users upon successful check-in/check-out.

Send alerts for missed check-ins or prolonged stays.

Admin Dashboard
View live logs of users.

Filter logs by date, user, and location time signed in ,time signed out documented movement period breaks.

Export reports of attendance data.

2. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance & Scalability
The system should handle multiple users simultaneously.

Optimize battery usage for mobile geolocation tracking.

Database queries should be efficient for retrieving logs.

Security
Secure authentication using JWT & HTTP-only cookies.

Store sensitive data using encryption.

Prevent unauthorized API access with role-based access control (RBAC).

API & Integration
The backend should provide RESTful APIs.

Support mobile & web clients.

Use Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap for geolocation.

Deployment & Hosting
Deploy the backend using Docker.

Use AWS/GCP/Firebase for scalable hosting.

Implement CI/CD pipelines for smooth updates.
